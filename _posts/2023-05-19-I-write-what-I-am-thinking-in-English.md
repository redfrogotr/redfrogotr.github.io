Thinking is important.

I am trying learning English hard. Recently, I read a viewpoint that thinking in English is pretty useful for deeper learning it from [a website](https://bewaters.me/limxtop/2021/08/18/English-introduction/). Then I always think writing is a kind of highly-effective to stimulate and distill thinking. So I decide to write in English, to record what I am thinking.

I also read an inspiring quote:

>‚ÄúI write¬†entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm¬†looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear.‚Äù ‚Äï Joan Didion.

So I hope this will be a good beginning.

Title: The Power of Thinking and Writing in English

Introduction: Learning English is a journey I am dedicated to. Recently, I came across an intriguing viewpoint on the importance of thinking in English for deeper language acquisition. Inspired by this idea, I believe that writing, in particular, serves as a highly effective tool to stimulate and distill my thoughts. With this in mind, I have made the decision to write in English, allowing me to not only improve my language skills but also document my evolving thoughts and experiences.

Supporting Evidence: Through personal experiences, I have witnessed the benefits of thinking in English. For instance, when I encounter new words or concepts, actively engaging my thoughts in English helps me form stronger connections and gain a more profound understanding. By thinking in English, I am able to process information directly in the target language, thereby improving my fluency and comprehension.

Quote Integration: Joan Didion's words resonate deeply with my aspirations. She once said, "I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear." This quote beautifully captures the essence of my endeavor. Like Didion, I believe that writing in English will enable me to explore my own thoughts, gain clarity about my desires and concerns, and uncover the meaning behind my experiences.

Structured Paragraphs: To effectively cultivate my language skills, I have adopted a structured approach. Each paragraph focuses on a specific aspect of the importance of thinking and writing in English. By organizing my thoughts in this manner, I can convey my ideas more coherently and facilitate a smoother flow of information for the reader.

Conclusion: In conclusion, embracing the power of thinking and writing in English has opened up a new dimension in my language learning journey. By consciously immersing myself in the language, I can deepen my understanding, improve my fluency, and cultivate my own unique perspective. I am excited about this new beginning and the countless benefits it holds. Writing in English will not only enhance my language skills but also serve as a valuable record of my growth and development along the way.
