> You don't know how the right path should be, but you know the wrong.

Resigning the job is definitely the right decision. What is under the solitude is the fresh and new vigor. There is one period in this month in which due to I always being one person, I feel so lonely. Initially, I cannot live well with this state but I have learnt how to enjoy it now. Evenly, I find I have been reluctant to come back the previous lifestyle that the work seeps into your mind and seize it. The feeling of freedom is so wonderful! Confidence and engaging in learning brought me to the realization that I have the ability achieving my goal. **Diving in what you are interested in will make your thought become the reality.**

## What I Learnt

### Making friends is not difficult as imagined, but matched one is

We tend to assume that some communities and organizations have high requirements for joining. For example, we may think members of English corner are good at speaking English. Actually, most of them are not. What is worth to appraise is they are brave. They dare to speak without overthinking and to ask other speakers to repeat their sentences that they don't understand. So, **being brave is a sort of necessary ability that we should possess**. 

On the other hand, if we feel lonely, we can easily find some activities to meet strangers. As long as you would like to, or say don't mind to, make friends, just starting talking with them. Then your goal will be achieved. However, what many people really want to say when they say making friends is hard. In fact, they mean *making matched friends is definitely difficult*. My opinion is **only we start to talk more details with others will it be possible finding a friend who you really appreciate.** 

### Time must be made, even though you are free

Many things are stealing our time, like social media and some trivia. Particularly, some positive goals may have side-effect. Too many goals will scramble for your time, which causes some not quite important things suck away your time. You even did not realize it. So, I think **time must be made, even though you have a lot of time.** 

Meanwhile, to much trivia causes we can not focus easily, which further leads to we doing work inefficiently, even ineffectively. That is why focusing for one hours is significantly different with doing four times of focusing for fifteen minutes. Much cold-start energy and time is wasted.

## What I can improve

### Both of reading and writing are a kind of state

May I consider reading few books and almost writing nothing should be adjusted? Someone select a hobby to help them maintain a good state, reading and writing is this one for me. 

I plan to reserve 30 minutes for reading every day when I have to finish other works. There are two ways to live a life, one is planning it, another one is being casual to it. Planing, sometimes, make it become a task, a burden. I just hope to wipe off this deliberateness.

### From rough to fine

I plan to build a *human behavior model* that at least is valid to myself. First of all, it must be very rough. There are a lot of waste of resources in it. But it is **simple**. This point is its core feature. When there is new stimuli trying to crowd out your official time, we should consider whether it is worth and how many time we would give it. The model would be finer gradually.

## Important events

So far, my level of IELTS is 6.0-6.5 (listening), 6.5-7(reading), 3-4 essays (writing) and big gap (speaking). I have seen my progress this month, though I plan to pass my exam in one month initially (it seems be quite challenging now!ü§£).

And I learnt to cook several dishes. ü•© + ü´ë + ü•ï + ü•ì  + üçó? maybe?

## Last Words

**Keeping moving** is more important than other advices. Maintaining a good state to live!
