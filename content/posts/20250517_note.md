I think **most of us are poisoned deeply by work**. One of key reasons is that we have become distracted and addicted to stimuli. I am the example. I am always in a hurry and overwhelmed by worry about tasks that have tight deadlines. I feel exhausted every day when I get home yet I still want to watch short-video on Bilibili or Rednote to relax. And I find my colleagues have the same habit. But on Saturdays when I am free, I do not feel the urge to engage in this behavior. Because I encountered this kind of situation many times, I already know how to handle it. However, I still believe that work is toxic.

This afternoon, I read *[The 4-Hour Workweek](https://fourhourworkweek.com/)* at a slow pace. I read a section that discusses the difference between *being efficient* and *being effective*. It was particularly thought-provoking in relation to time management. We often push ourselves to be efficient and stay busy, but we do not invest time in seeking more effective ways of working. The key insight is that when we realize we are neither learning new things nor becoming more proficient despite our busyness, it is necessary to pause and reflect on our current state. I believe that this is a potentially harmful condition.
