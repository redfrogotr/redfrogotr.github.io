Many people recommend this book, and say it has had a deep influence for their attitude for life and work. When I have finished this book, I found it's really a fantastic life wisdom book and it has changed my thinking paradigm(sometimes XD). The more significant thing for me is it help me try to **build a peaceful heart** gradually. To be honest, I think it can offer some inspirations that work for almost everyone.

So, which 7 habits they are? They are:
- Be proactive
- Begin with the end in mind
- Put first things first
- Think win/win
- Seek first to understand, then to be understood
- Synergize
- Sharpen the saw

and *inside-out* is appended additionally. Each habit that has been mentioned above is worth spending some time thinking and introducing carefully. Maybe the better way is you go to read this book(actually that is I don't want to introduce them again). So I just try to discuss some topics.

## People As A Whole

Repeat some times to think about it. Today I have met a joke about a yoga man called by himself talks about the meaning of life. He can give the answer very directly. That's a little unusual. Because although person as a kind of animal always is same, there are absolutely some differences about what they want. We can't give a general answer. Of course, that's just my personal oponion.

But I actually think we can find the life's meanings by ourselves rather than get the answer from others' points. **The things people really want sometimes are not the things they want now.** See us as a whole rather than some seperated pieces can be helpful. But that's really hard. Sometimes the motivation is so strong that we can't control us to act as we plan to do at the begining. It seems like we become a kind of slave of body. Apply a peaceful mind, in fact, I have tried to face them and feel them. After failing, I analyse the failing reason ant try again. The fact is it starts becoming better. We must take some actions to change the reality rather than wait it to become normal or even better(actually it's the first habit above *be proactive*). So we also can have a try.

When we think ourselves as a whole and start to act in the concrete subjective mentality, something starts to change. We become a simple, single one who doesn't have too many desires to the abundant material world because some good things in reality actually are not something he/she needs. So they choose to give up them rather than take them or accept them so that they become burdens.  

## Open-minded again / Cooperation

Actually I have discussed in my previous artice. I talk about it again to express it's really imporant. Why we need to be open-minded? Because we live in society except we live as *Walden* like *Thoreau*. That is *public victory* the author has mentioned. First of all, when we seek to cooperate we should not require others to be open-minded. That is if they are not you won't go to cooperate. Before this, *be proactive*(first habit). We must express our goodwills at first then seek them to show that(in fact, show goodwill is a better living startegy in biology that is introduced in book *The Extended Selfish Gene* in *好心有好报* section). Meanwhile, some people have found it works in fact.

That's a temporaty short book note just for a record. Good night!
