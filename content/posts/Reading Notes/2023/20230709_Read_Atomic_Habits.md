I spend almost two months intermittently reading this english book that enlightens me from many perspectives. Maybe due to it is an english book I don't recognize every word, I have to read it carefully, so that I think I have gotten more acknowledge than reading a normal Chinese book. So time really can affect our recognization even if for the same book.

It's a popular and best selled book that indicates it is not difficult to read for normal people and its acknowledge is maybe easy to understand. Although its logic isn't very strict(I mean it is a little bit exaggerated for illustrating one building habit method is valid), these methods, points and insights really enlighten me and make me see Habit from a new look. So I'm sure I will recommend this book for my friends and hope it can help more people.

# Identity is origination, habit is process and result

If we just pursuit the goal, we are exhausted because the goal doesn't match current ourselves. That enforce us to do something we don't really want to do. However, if we try to transform our perspective, the situation will be quite different for building habits. 

The first question we need to consider is **Who do we want to be**? Let ourselves stand in a new position, our behavior is naturally to do something that corresponds to the identity.

# To do specific things

When a plan is vague, we are usually used to delay it. I don't konw why. Maybe unclear things need to consume more energy. Once a plan is becoming clear or say the clarity is determined, we are more possible to do it.

You can try *implementaion intentions* and *habit stacking*.

# Split space

**One space, one use.** The most important thing is don't let good habits and bad habits mix in one  space. When it happens, the easier ones will win out(usually they are bad habits). We can compress several similar and good habits to one space to do them. For examle, I have bought a new iPad. I use it to learn english solely and have not download any video apps and games.

# Make expected identiy connect to more ones

Join in a group or think about people you respect.

# Walk slowly, but never backward

Some sentences like **get hands dirty** and **keep it going**. Despite we can't improve in moment, insist on doing it. We can't keep improvement continously.

# Make it easy

1. Prime the environment for future use.
2. Use two-minute rule.

# Make it satisfying

1. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.
2. Habit tracker: try to record what we have done every time.

# Advanced tactics

1. Choose the right field of competation that best suit us.
2. Flow: set manageable difficulty and to keep doing attensively.
3. Reflect ourselves regularly.
