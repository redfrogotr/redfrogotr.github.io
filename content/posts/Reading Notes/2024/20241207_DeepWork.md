Most of us are aware that digital devices have changed our lives in the past 20 years. We frequently check messages on WeChat or Facebook or Email and spend hours a day watching short videos on Douyin or Tiktok. The Internet has made it easier for us to connect with each other, but it has also made it harder for us to concentrate on our work. We know we need to think deeply and work efficiently, but we find it harder to do than before.

The book *Deep Work* tries to help us solve this problem, or say help us identify this kind of state of us clearly and help us come back to **deep work**.

When we talk about deep work we talk two parts about it to give us a more comprehensive view of it. First, it is *why we need to do deep work*. We all know it is necessary and we have some reasons, but they can't become the core force to support us do deep work continuously. For example, we say deep work helps us finish work more efficiently. However, we don't know why it is this and how it works. So we can say our points are a little superficial. Second, we talk about the methods, that is *how to achieve deep work*. It includes many methods to go into deep work, it also corrects some common wrong methods that are not really useful to work effectively.

## The Ideas

### 01 Deep work is valuable

First, let's distinguish *deep work* and *shallow work*.

> **Deep Work**: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

> **Shallow Work**: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.


We can compare two types of work using the following table to quickly identify them.

| Aspect | Deep Work | Shallow Work |
| :--- | ---- | ---- |
| Prerequisites | professional knowledges | little or no |
| Input costs | spend a lot of energy and time thinking or creating or learning | fixed time and energy |
| Difficulty of execution | hard to come into | easy to come into |
| Output | creativity-filled and hard-to-replicate results | assembly-line results |

Deep work helps us finish difficult works and create something valuable and special. 

The notes from the book are:

> We need two core abilities for thriving in the new economy, that is:
> 1. The ability to **quickly master hard things**
> 2. The ability to **produce at an elite level**, in terms of both quality and speed

If we want to possess the two abilities, we can use deep work. It is applicable.

First, to quickly master hard things, we can leverage *deliberate practice*. 

> Its core components are usually identified as follows:
> 1. your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve or an idea you're trying to master;
> 2. you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it's most productive.

Second, to produce at an elite level, there is a formula.

> High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

*Time Spent* is easy to control, as for *intensity of focus*, we should avoid to be interrupted and be distracted. Every time we switch the tasks we are working on, we shift our attention from the previous task to the next. If these attentions are not related, we need to expend extra energy and attention to align them. That is *attention residue*.

By working on a single hard task for a long time without switching, we can minimize the negative impact of attention residue from other tasks, allowing us to maximize performance on this one task.

### 02 Why do we prefer shallow work?

First, it's **the principle of least resistance**. Shallow work is easier to do than deep work. When there are two tasks to do, we tend to choose the one that is easier to do.

Second, it's **the addiction to the Internet**. The Internet has reduced the difficulty of getting dopamine. We surf the Internet and browse new contents, and even check messages and emails from phone to anticipate something fresh will happen. Frankly, the Internet helps improve the quality of our lives, like communication is easier and informations are interconnected. But fewer and fewer people are noticing the negative impact of it on our lives.

Third, we **see busyness as proxy for productivity**. As mentioned in the first reason, most of time deep work is hard to do and life is hard, we would like to make our lives easier. We pretend that we are busy by doing trivial works to escape doing difficult one. Also we can find a reason we have too many trivia to do so that we don't have time to do really important things.

### 03 Deep work is meaningful

I want to separate deep work from simple tools. I think they are very different at many aspects. We get happiness and tranquil through thinking hard. Deep work facilitates we come into this kind of state. Meanwhile, it makes us get focused. Deep work is the best strategy to apply in life. I illustrate the meaning of deep work from three aspects following.

First, **our feeling actually is closely tied to what we pay attention to**. We often say that achieving something makes us happy, while experiencing misfortune makes us sad. But for one thing that we acclaim it is bad sometimes is good when comparing it to a worse thing. Result of one thing is just fact which isn't with good part and bad part. Actually the feeling comes from our reaction. For instance, the feelings of someone facing a meal will differ greatly between someone who is hungry and someone who is already full. When we pay attention to the positive side, we feel better. Deep work reduces the possibility of considering the negative side. We just focus on one thing that is positive.

Second, **the feeling of going depth is interesting and fantastic**. The flow state is a terminology in psychology. When we do one thing that is challengeable but is not very hard to finish, we come into this state. We forget the existence of time and do it more and more better over time. During the process of doing the thing, we are focused and feel energized.

Third, **focus on the process rather than the result**. Steve Jobs said, "*the journey is the reward*." The reason of why we need to do in this way is we are consequent, but the result is discrete. Results are connected by processes. When we just jump between these points of result, we can't get their meanings. We fall into the trap of achieving one and one goals tiredly. Deep work gets us isolate from distractions to do one thing in a long time period.

## The Methods

This part is about the practices of deep work. It changes the perspective of we perceiving work.

### 01 Work Deeply

#### Choose the appropriate philosophy of deep work scheduling

This section introduces how to work deeply. Deep work is about how to finish hard work. There are four philosophies of deep work scheduling.
1. The monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling. That is getting rid of interference from trivia and desires. This state is difficult to reach but it is necessary to achieve big goals.
2. The bimodal philosophy of deep work scheduling. This philosophy separate two periods from time. One is for working and living in a reclusive state, and one is working and living in society. This philosophy thinks the news and information from society is helpful to do work better when working in isolating state.
3. The rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling. This is about habit and ritualize. People who apply this philosophy live in society. But they have a fixed time period to work without distraction.
4. The journalist philosophy of deep work scheduling. That is when one is free, they will go to work. This is a really focused state that is paying attention to one thing until it gets done.

We can select the appropriate philosophy of deep work scheduling according to our conditions. If our work require to respond quickly, we can apply the rhythmic philosophy or the journalist philosophy. If we really need a period to think hard and make important decisions, we can choose the bimodal philosophy. 

#### ❤️Ritualize

We often think inspirations of artists is from occasions. That's not true. Actually the inspiration comes from rituals. That is **there is a fixed period every day to do their works**. I think it belongs to the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling. Depending on the continuous deep thinking and dedicating work, they make great achievements.

There are three necessary questions we need to answer if we want to apply this approach.
1. Where to do deep work and how long
2. Decide what to do before the ritualize
3. Prepare enough resources for maintaining the quality of work

*I have tried this method many times. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I find I can apply it more and more better over time. This article that is going to finish is in the process applying this method.*

#### ❤️Execute Like a Business: 4DX

4DX is the abbreviation of *4 Disciplines* from the book *4 Disciplines of Execution*. It is about how to execute in business, however it is also suitable to deep work.
1. Discipline #1: Focus on the wildly important. We must identify the most important thing in our works. But it's really hard to finish, because it seems there are some works that all are important for us in one moment. I think we still can prioritize them. We can use this strategy, "*if you want to win the war for attention, don't try to say 'no' to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say 'yes' to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.*"
2. Discipline #2: Act on the lead measures. There are two types of metrics to measure our success. They are *lag* measures and *lead* measures. Lag measures is about our final result. But lead measures is what we have done to achieve final results. "*The problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior.*" We use lag measures drive us.
3. Discipline #3: Keep a compelling scoreboard. Scoreboard makes us pay attention to it. When we put a scoreboard in a noticeable place, we care about how much we have done to finish our goals, so that we are more engaged to work.
4. Discipline #4: Create a cadence of accountability. Our lead measures sometimes is not in the right path to arrive our final results. We can use the habit of a weekly review to figure out how to ensure a good score.

Some insightful themes:
1. Make grand gestures
2. Don't work alone
3. Be lazy: downtime is ok and necessary

### 02 Embrace Boredom





---

## Embrace Boredom

1. The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.
2. It is hard to switch from shallow work to deep work.
3. Reduce working time and improve working intensity.
4. Mediate Productively: 
	1. Be Wary of Distractions and Looping
	2. Structure Your Deep Thinking: review relevant variables for solving the problem.
5. Memorize a Deck of Cards: a method for remembering many things

## Quit Social Media

1. 2 realities or points: 
	1. We increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate.
	2. The impotence with which knowledge workers currently discuss this problem of network tools and attention.
2. The benefits of social media are minor and somewhat random.
3. The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection: You're justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don't use it.
4. We should weigh pros and cons of a tool.
5. The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.
6. Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits
	1. Strategies:
		1. Identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and your personal life.
		2. List for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal. These activities should be specific enough to allow you to clearly picture doing them. On the other hand, they should be general enough that they're not tied to a onetime outcome.
	2. The Law of the Vital Few: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.
7. Don't Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself: see flomo

## Drain the Shallows

1. The shallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is less vital than it often seems in the moment.
2. The value of deep work vastly outweigh the value of shallow, but this doesn't mean that you must quixotically pursue a schedule in which all of your time is invested in depth.
3. Deliberate practice: an hour a day is a reasonable limit. For those familiar with the rigors of such activities, the limit expands to something like four hours, but rarely more.
4. Schedule Every Minute of Your Day: 
	1. To keep things reasonably clean, the minimum length of a block should be thirty minutes.
	2. Be pragmatic: evaluate the needed time of one thing validly and be glad to update its time.
	3. overflow conditional blocks: buffer blocks
5. Quantify the Depth of Every Activity: see flomo
6. Finish Your Work by Five Thirty: 
	1. fixed-schedule productivity
7. Become Hard to Reach / 让自己难以被找到: see flomo

## Conclusion

1. The ability to concentrate is a skill that *gets valuable things done*.
