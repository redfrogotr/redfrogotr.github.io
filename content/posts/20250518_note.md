Today I want to talk about *state*.

Most of us recognize that our emotional state influence our behavior. When we are highly excited, we tend to challenge difficult goals. When we feel sad or mentally depleted, we may prefer to do nothing and even experience emotional pain. As a result, we often strive to maintain a positive state of mind. However, when I have free time, such as Sundays, I sometimes find myself uncertain about what I should do. I am aware that this may be considered a non-question, yet the dilemma persists: **How should I use my free time?**

I often feel that I have many options available to me–for example, practicing English listening or speaking, watching an enlightening podcast video or completing tasking on my to-do list. **The difficulty lies in my inability to prioritize them effectively.** As a result, I struggle to engage deeply with any single activity. **While I am doing one task, I find myself thinking about another, even believing it might be the better choice.**

A moment ago, I tell my this problem to ChatGPT. It understands my problem, helps me analysis the cause, gives me advices and offers me solution. Now I feel much better. Here is its answer:

> 1. **🧘 Train Presence, Not Just Productivity**
> 		1. The real problem isn’t time—it’s _attention_. Try:
> 			1. A short 2-minute mindfulness before starting anything: “I choose to be here now.”
> 			2. When switching activities, pause and say (mentally): “I finished that. Now this.”
> 		2. The goal is to be _fully in one thing at a time_. That’s where satisfaction grows.
> 2. **🔄 Reflect, Not Regret**
> 		1. At the end of Sunday, briefly jot down:
> 			- What you did
> 			- How you felt
> 			- What you’d change
> 		2. This builds a personal feedback loop that makes future Sundays easier to shape.
> 1. **🎯 Remember: Doing One Thing Well Is Enough**
> 		1. You don’t need to _maximize_ your free time. You need to _inhabit_ it. One meaningful hour beats five scattered ones. Give yourself permission to choose and commit, even imperfectly.

Hope it is also helpful to you.
