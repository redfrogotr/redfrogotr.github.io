How do we take action?

Most of time we take action by *animal instinct*. It is good and bad, but just the reality is so. We can't change this. Try to be proactive, we can be to understand the **mechanism**(I don't plan to talk it, and I assume you have learned the mechanism), then take action. One of the a little bit better ways I think is to **find out the most things**. So now I am trying to do this.

First of all, I thought of the epitaph which is enlightened by the book *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*. When I imagine the last day in the world, I review my whole life and all things I have done, what I want to leave to the world? Look back many years from that time point, I think we can find the most important things. A simple way is to **ask ourselves whether we will care about the things that we are doing now**[1]. We must ask this question periodically. 

Sometimes, we don't know what we want, but on the contrary we know what we don't want. Does it mean we just don't do what we don't want is ok? I don't think so. Because the things we want to do actually are only a super small part of the world. Don't take action makes us remain the origin or drifts us to an unkown place(the possibility of it's destination almost is zero).

This is a quite difficult question and absolutely we need to think about it many times until we get an available answer. Maybe it will change after a period of time.

Just now, I am trying to find my own answer.

## Skills

Naval said, *无论处于人生的哪个阶段，努力的目标都是不断的提高自己的独立性，而不是升职加薪。* Our personal competitiveness comes from our unique. Both **more advanced skill and more skills** we have learned can be helpful achiving this, and then help us survive better. We can choose to expand skills or master one skill. Expanding offers more possibility that we can find and mastering make us unreplaceable. You know master one skill consumes plenty of time and if we move this time to expand skills we can learn a considerable number of skills at normal level.

I think I am young, so I choose to expand, to find possibility. It's a threat for my current job because it requires me to make progress at a specific domain. **A company's management feature is make employee work beyond their basic level to achive more outcome.** It's not the company's problem, it's the competing rule. When a person was promoted, that means his/her comprehensive ability(actually there are only some specific aspects) has been over the average, and he/she has reached the next new level.

Why we endeavor to get promotion? One is money. It's reasonable. Another one is it's a proof that proves we have the ability to support this level, or say it means we are more advanced for the work position. At the current time point, I think I need the proof to prove I can do something more competitive at one aspect(It really doesn't matter which aspect).
