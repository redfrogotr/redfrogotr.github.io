I a little like the night because it helps me think something deeper steadily by offering the quiet environment. Life always makes big changes that sometimes I haven't gotten used to before it happens again, although some changes are made by myself because I think I need to make myself keep moving, need to make myself do some challenging things. I admit I have made some mistakes for my decision, for example I decided to run a full marathon at the wrong time. And I absolutely don't know which decisions are right. I have to make a try. So some wrong decisions should be accepted. And I still don't know whether something now I am doing is right. However, I think they will be right when we see them with a long vision except the time points to do them may not be appropriate.

For new workers who just first enter into the workplace and are not experiencing and don't have many authorities, like recruit, **what they can do if they want to be influential?** Or say if they want to build their own business and companies after some years. Now, I think I possibly have found a feasible path to achieve this.

At the beginning, new workers know very few people, and they are unfamiliar for the programming technology stack. So when they start to enter the workplace, they are moderate and always keep learning. After a while, they become familiar for the business and are skilled to use the technology stack and they already have finished and launched some functions where only they can explain them clearly,  they become influential. In this situation, **the one just needs to keep learning and work hard** when he wants to achieve the goal. Where are the challenging things? **Actually they are just the way we step-by-step finish them with good quality.**
## 01 Age advantages

I don't mean young workers have a good and healthy body so they can work harder. There are always two sides for almost everything. Young usually means lack of experience, impetuousness and something, but it also has some advantages. That's what I want to talk because we shouldn't always complain shortcomings and something we don't have, and we should try to make use of what we have, like the age.

**One of the age advantages I can think of is we can easy to change the direction.** Because we must be responsible for our histories that are successful or not. When our backgrounds have accumulated enough, change our directions become heavy burden. That's a little like the relationship about small company and big company.

So that means we can make many attempts very quickly. But we shouldn't always try anything with short-term interests. **The most important thing about this way is we are finding our real interests and find what we love and what we really want to do.** At a time point, it is time we can stop to try next thing if we are really sure that we have found that.

## 02 Develop abilities and skills that they need later

Meanwhile, our goals determine our paths. What we have done actually is the base-stone of what we will do next. Otherwise, we have to always learn new things (That's not pragmatic because we are just improving the breadth rather than the depth). 
- If someone want to build their own company, they need to develop the abilities about building independent products rather than just do some fixing tasks. So practice is more important than learning new knowledge (I mean practice should a large part). They should develop and practice the needed abilities more.
- If someone want to be influential, they should learn more. Build their own knowledge map and then to get close to more systems and products.
