> Inject some difficulties into my life, so I try to use English to write my interview this time and maybe every time after this.

## 01 Work

I'm basically just hanging on at work. I almost have lost interest in work. That's not what I want to do. Although work in large companies offers high-level salary,  it really restrict employees' ability of self-growth. And work patterns employees apply personally and collaboratively have dropped in fixed and rigid pattern, so that the real ability to innovate, not literally, has parted ways with the company. 

Middle-level managers lack connections of shared interests and shared mission in consensus. In contrary, they care about how many business from company they have reined and they always want to do things that is from 0 to 1 and brush off works they take over from other teams. Some excellent work experiences and practice cannot be persisted, or say some very helpful explorations are bound to employees rather than persisting in the way of documents or continuously revising platforms.

## 02 Life

1. **Love and my girlfriend**: my girlfriend traveled to Hangzhou and accompany with me this month. I had many times look forward to this moment I met her again so that it is very difficult to make me rekindle interest for work. Four days with her are so wonderful and impressive. Due to we live in two cities far away from each other, we can't keep staying by each other's side, so I always savor every time of being together.
2. **Distance from death**: my grandfather's health has become more and more terrible, this month he discharged from hospital and rested at home. I returned to hometown to visit him in weekend. I know this may be the last time I see him and I have to accept my farewell to him. Death imposes human to reflect. **Life is really short, I think.**
3. **Goals of last month this year**: the last month of the year has arrived, which means that after this month, this year will end.
	1. **Sharpen time management**: Inspired by *[Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work)*, I will build my habit model to maximize both work and learning efficiency.
	2. **Finish a small Rust project**: I have finished the book *[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)*, next stage is better mastering it.
	3. **Stable handstand**: I can already do a headstand. I have always wanted to learn to do a handstand and my birthday wish is it. I know it's up to us, so it will happen I think.
## 03 New Cognitions

1. Get knowledges by podcast: English podcast has better quality to get knowledges and informations than Chinese podcasts. But my english listening is not good, I changed the listening way that is listening directly to watch the podcast video, so I can use translator tool to extract subtitle. I have watched podcasts about [Super communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_lpMg-U1Dk&list=PLgbAKOueStpi8sbGo23yVKm0uP3wImXRy), Andrew Huberman, Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bezos by Lex Fridman.

## 04 Milestones

1. Three books: 芯片战争，李光耀观天下和 The Rust Programming Language.
2. Learn to do a headstand.
3. Meet Lai.
