> I know making a decision is always hard. Because we don't know what will happen in the future. We love certainty. It's acceptable if we consider this is a kind of not-bad lifestyle. However, reality is not matched with my current working state. So I have to change. I seek the call.

As I decided to commit my resignation in May 20th, work staff started to gradually decrease. I feel relaxed this month. I just finished work handover. I got a refreshed state that makes me energetic. It is like a *dividing line* before which I am busy and exhausted employee and after which I am a new person with empty background.

## Travelling

I traveled twice. One is going to HongKong with my girlfriend, and another one is going to Wanning in Hainan with all my teammates. Both of them have left unforgettable memories. I am not this kind of people who love traveling and is glad to spend time traveling. I am not hot to traveling. But I think traveling is worthwhile. It brings me to visionary motivations that I wouldn't experience if I stayed around home. Sometimes, traveling makes me forget the version of myself defined by work. My colleagues need vacations more than me. Because they still need to work.

## Learning

1. iOS development: I learned the tutorial for beginners. I have always wanted to learn iOS development. When I don't have much work to do anymore, the free time suits for starting this new project.
3. Reading(two books):
	1. Shoe Dog
	2. 4 Thousand Weeks
4. IELTS English exam: I started to prepare for it. That is necessary for every students that want to study abroad. This is not easy for me and It will spend some time. I have considered this and I am confident to pass it.

## Lessons

1. I didn't feel high productivity in the last few days of this month. I stayed in home and learned English for a whole day. I am adapting myself.
2. To build rituals.
