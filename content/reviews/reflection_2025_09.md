Ok, let's start.

This month it rained a lot. It's just like emotions, fulfilled by the rain but also damped and wrapped tightly by it. Of course, we saw sunshine sometimes. People in my hometown expect the good weather because dry lands make it possible collecting corns. All of them depend on the weather to live. We are similar. We depends on something in city, such as content consumers, personal consumers in supermarket or some businesses. All of them are unpredictable, even though personal endeavor plays a certain level role in it. A sentence in *[The Art Of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War)* is "天时地利人和", which orders these features. **So don't be too sad for current selves. You must be patient for good time.**

## 1. Highlights of the Month

- What were the **three best moments** this month?
	- Moment 1: I finished my IELTS test, even though I didn't know the result and I thought I might got a low band in speaking part. Actually, I finally can take a break for IELTS preparation that had lasted for two and half month. So it's really energy-consuming. 
	- Moment 2: I finished reading [The Psychology Of Money](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Psychology-Money-Timeless-Lessons-Happiness/dp/0857197681) this month. I enjoyed the time of reading like time flows through me no matter what the book is about. Specially, the book is inspiring for seeing investment and money.
	- Moment 3: I met my families after this May. The feeling of meeting families always is healing because they always accompany with you without interests.
- What am I most **grateful for**?
	- I am most grateful for finishing IELTS test. I see it as a milestone whether the final score reaches my expectation. It represents I have made a progress in English learning.
- What **went well** (habits, work, relationships, health)?
	- It's English learning and reading, two key parts of my life.
	- Also, it contains of Yoga, which I insisted on doing it several times a week. Yoga not only stretches my body also reshape my mind when doing it.
## 2. Challenges & Lessons

	- It was IELTS. It was really challenging for me. Especially there are multiply parts I need to prepare for, like listening and speaking.
